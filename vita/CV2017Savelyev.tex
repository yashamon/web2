\section{\sc Research interests} 
Symplectic and differential geometry, especially Gromov-Witten and
Floer theory. More recently also geometric quantization and Yang-Mills
theory. Connections of the above with algebraic topology, mathematical physics and dynamical
systems. 
% My main research theme concerns the study of an interplay of Gromov-Witten and
% Floer theory, with Hofer geometry and algebraic topology.
% Floer-Gromov-Witten theory is concerned  with probing  symplectic
% manifolds by studying various spaces of pseudo-holomorphic maps of a
% Riemann surface into the manifold. This has close connections to and
% sometimes origin in some structures in modern theoretical physics,
% particularly in string theory. Hofer geometry, which is a certain
% natural Finsler geometry on the group of Hamiltonian
% symplectomorphisms, comes into the picture
% because it often governs perturbation data needed in construction of
% the underlying analytic moduli spaces. On the other hand the algebraic
% topology connection in my work is roughly analogous to the way connections and
% curvature enter into construction of Chern classes, and so into algebraic
% topology. This is partially illustrated via the theory of quantum
% characteristic classes introduced in my thesis.
% I have also done some work involving Yang-Mills theory, and
% geometric quantization. Some of my work also concerns aspects of Hamiltonian
% dynamics.

% % \section { \bf Proposed research description} % % In our previous work we have defined quantum characteristic classes. These are % % certain natural cohomology classes of the free loop space $ L\text % % {Ham}(M, \omega)$ of the group $ \text {Ham}(M, \omega)$ of Hamiltonian % % symplectomorphisms of a symplectic manifold.  % % These classes are defined in terms % % of certain Gromov-Witten invariants and % % % , and % % % greatly generalize the Seidel representation, which is a homomorphism from the % % % fundamental group of $ \text {Ham}(M, \omega)$ to quantum homology $QH _{2n} % % % (M)$.  % % we have shown that they % % are a very powerful tool in the study of higher dimensional topology and Finsler % % geometry of the group $ \text {Ham}(M, \omega)$, with its Hofer metric.  % % % % We are currently exploring  a deep interaction % % between energy flow on the loop spaces of compact Lie groups, holomorphic % % aspects of its Morse theory,  Finsler geometric properties of the % % group $ \text {Ham}(M, \omega)$ and quantum characteristic classes.  % %    % % The immediate importance of the above project is to topology of the group  % % $\text {Ham}(M, \omega)$, about which there is still very little known general % % information.  % % However, a possibly more important application is to the Finsler % % geometry of the group $ \text {Ham}(M, \omega)$, which was in fact the prime % % motivation for construction of quantum characteristic % % classes. Outside of our previous work  % % there is still very little known about higher dimensional Finsler geometrical % % properties of $ \text {Ham}(M, \omega)$. Our project would shed some light % % on this important problem both in immediate applications and perhaps even more % % so by the methods which we intend to develop.   % \section{Research papers} % {\em Quantum characteristic classes and the {H}ofer metric}, Geometry Topology, % (2008).\\ % \emph{Virtual Morse theory on $\Omega \text {Ham}(M, \omega)$}, %   available at arXiv:0804.0059, submitted to Journal of Differential Geometry.  %   \\ %  \emph{Hamiltonian string background}, in %    preparation \\ %  \emph{Hamiltonian cagegory and spectral length}, in preparation \\  \section {\sc Selected invited  talks} % \emph {Morse homology}; Stony Brook, a presentation for graduate students \\ % \emph{On polyfold view point of Morse theory}: Leipzig, Workshop in Symplectic Field Theory, 2005. \\\\ % \emph{Seidel representation}; expository, Stony Brook, symplectic geometry

% \section {\sc Future invited talks}
 \section {\sc Teaching experience}
3 years of lecturing experience as a graduate student at Stony
Brook university. With 1 course per semester load. These were
very large calculus sections with 100 or more enrolled students
per section.  I also TA'd at Stony Brook for calulus, business
calculus, and graduate algebraic topology (twice). 


Another 2.5 years of lecturing experience as a visiting
assistant professor at University of Massachusets, Amherst.  (Away for half a
semester at MSRI).
I was doing 2 courses/sections per semester. Each section was
small about 20-30 enrolled students. 
These were calculus and multivariable calculus sections.


\emph{Teaching at current home institution University of Colima, Mexico.}

Spring 2016, Geometry-Topology: An advanced course for undergraduates following
Spivak's Differential Geometry, and the classical papers of Shing-Shen Chern on
the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.

Fall 2016, Calculus 3: Standard course in vector calculus following Lang.

Spring 2017, Topics in dynamical systems: A somewhat advanced course for
undergraduates including: smooth dynamical systems, elements of
symbolic dynamical systems, Markov chains, structural stability, Smale Horse
shoe, Hamiltonian dynamics, Morse theory
and Morse homology.

Fall 2017, Topology: A beginning course in topology, fairly standard except for
early introduction of nets, and approach to Van-Kampen theorem via groupoids.

Fall 2017, Analysis: A very first course in rigorous analysis for
undergraduates.
