<h1 id="teaching-experience">Teaching experience</h1>
<p>3 years of lecturing experience as a graduate student at Stony Brook university. With 1 course per semester load. These were very large calculus sections with 100 or more enrolled students per section. I also TA’d at Stony Brook for calulus, business calculus, and graduate algebraic topology (twice).</p>
<p>Another 2.5 years of lecturing experience as a visiting assistant professor at University of Massachusets, Amherst. (Away for half a semester at MSRI). I was doing 2 courses/sections per semester. Each section was small about 20-30 enrolled students. These were calculus and multivariable calculus sections.</p>

<p>Spring 2016, Geometry-Topology: An advanced course for undergraduates following Spivak’s Differential Geometry, and the classical papers of Shing-Shen Chern on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.</p>
<p>Fall 2016, Calculus 3: Standard course in vector calculus following Lang.</p>
<p>Spring 2017, Topics in dynamical systems: A somewhat advanced course for undergraduates including: smooth dynamical systems, elements of symbolic dynamical systems, Markov chains, structural stability, Smale Horse shoe, Hamiltonian dynamics, Morse theory and Morse homology.</p>
