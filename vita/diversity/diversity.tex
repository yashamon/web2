\title {Diversity Statement, Fall 2018}
\author{Yakov Savelyev}
\begin{document}  
\maketitle
Having emmigrated from Russia at the age of 14 to the USA, on a status of political refugee, which I somehow inherited from my father, I went to a fantastically multi-cultural John Bown high school in Queens, New York. My best friends were from India, Korea, China, Pakistan, Dominican Republic, and classical Americans.
I still keep in touch with many of them. This diversity was by far my favorite of early experiences in USA, (and still is) and I was profoundly happy in those high school years, to add my academic motivation was actually much improved relative to my years in Russia. I don't know if being Russian is much of an addition to diversity in itself, but I am certainly very open to it, in fact, so say my evaluation letters from students here in Colima, Mexico.
